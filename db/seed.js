My adolescent age means I can play and play for hours without getting tired, so a playmate of mine should be a dog with a lot of energy. My human and I love to go no long hikes together. Are you a busy human whose dog needs more exercise than you have time to give? Are you a human that needs a loving dog to cuddle with or a fellow dog-lover to go on walks with? If so, message my human! It sounds like we'd be a good match."
